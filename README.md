# Flower Picker Game


### Project Description
1. We operate a little bit differently here at our flower shop..
2. You will be given a bouquet cost at the start of your shopping.
3. You get to pick from from each of our flowers pictured (Tulip, Peony, Alstromeria, & Magnolia) and add to your personal bouquet!
4.The catch is,your bouquet cost MUST be the same price as the one that I give you at the start of your shopping AND the price of each flower will not be available for you.
5. If your bouquet total is higher than what I give you, then you unfortunately leave the shop with nothing.
6. But! If you so happen to match the given price, the bouquet is yours!
